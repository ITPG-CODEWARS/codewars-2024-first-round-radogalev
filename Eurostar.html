   <!-- Eurostar detailed description section-->
    <p class = "train-detailed-description">
        The Eurostar train service is a pioneering high-speed rail system connecting the United Kingdom with mainland Europe, offering a fast, convenient, and comfortable way to travel between some of Europe’s most iconic cities. Known for its distinct blue and yellow livery and exceptional passenger service, Eurostar primarily operates between London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam, among other destinations. Since its launch in 1994, Eurostar has revolutionized cross-channel travel by offering a swift and environmentally-friendly alternative to flying. Below is a detailed look at what makes Eurostar the preferred choice for European high-speed travel.
        <br>
        <strong>Key Specifications and Features</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>High-Speed Performance:</strong> Eurostar trains are engineered to operate at speeds up to 300 km/h (186 mph), reducing travel time between major European cities. For instance, the journey from London to Paris takes just over 2 hours.
        <br>
        <strong> Spacious Design:</strong> Eurostar’s e320 model, manufactured by Siemens, boasts an extended 16-car layout, accommodating up to 894 passengers per journey. This design ensures ample room, providing both comfort and efficiency for travelers.
        <br>
        <strong>Channel Tunnel Passage:</strong> One of Eurostar's defining features is its route through the Channel Tunnel (or "Chunnel"), a 50.5 km (31.4 miles) tunnel beneath the English Channel. This engineering marvel allows passengers to travel between the UK and mainland Europe in just 35 minutes.
        <br>
        <strong>Seating Classes:</strong> Eurostar offers three levels of seating—Standard, Standard Premier, and Business Premier. Each class is designed with passenger comfort in mind, with more legroom, power outlets, and dining options available at higher tiers.
        <br>
        <strong>Smooth and Quiet Ride:</strong> Eurostar’s trains are designed with noise reduction technology, providing passengers with a serene travel experience, even at top speeds. The ride is stable and smooth, minimizing disturbances for both work and relaxation.
        <br>
        <strong>Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Travel:</strong>
        Eurostar places a strong emphasis on sustainability and eco-friendly travel, positioning itself as one of the greenest ways to travel between the UK and Europe. A single Eurostar journey produces 90% less CO₂ than a comparable flight, thanks to its electric-powered engines and eco-conscious operations. Eurostar has also committed to reducing its carbon emissions further, making it a smart choice for environmentally aware travelers.
