    <!-- Acela Express detailed description section-->
    <p class = "train-detailed-description">
        The Acela Express, now rebranded simply as the Acela, is Amtrak’s flagship high-speed rail service, connecting major cities in the Northeast Corridor of the United States, including Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Known for its speed, comfort, and convenience, Acela offers business travelers and leisure passengers a premium alternative to regional rail and air travel. As the fastest train in the U.S., the Acela provides an efficient, eco-friendly solution for intercity transportation along one of the country’s busiest travel routes.

        Key Specifications and Features
        High-Speed Performance: Acela operates at speeds of up to 150 mph (240 km/h), covering the 450-mile stretch between Boston and Washington, D.C., in around 6.5 hours. This high-speed capability makes Acela the fastest rail service in the U.S., with significant time savings over other rail options.
        Tilting Technology: Acela trains are equipped with advanced tilting technology, allowing them to navigate curves more smoothly and efficiently at higher speeds. This technology not only enhances speed but also ensures a more comfortable ride by reducing the side-to-side motion passengers feel on traditional trains.
        Train Layout and Capacity: Acela trains feature a 6-car configuration, including a power car on each end, with seating for approximately 304 passengers. The seating arrangement prioritizes comfort and space, providing ample legroom and dedicated storage space for luggage.
        Quiet and Smooth Ride: Acela’s engineering minimizes noise and vibration, creating a quieter cabin environment ideal for work or relaxation. Advanced shock absorbers and acoustic insulation further reduce ambient noise levels.
        Comfort and Amenities
        Acela is known for its premium travel experience, making it especially popular among business and frequent travelers. The train is divided into two classes—First Class and Business Class—each designed to provide a comfortable, productive journey.
